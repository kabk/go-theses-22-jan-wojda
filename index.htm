    <p class="abstract">The main source of my research is Polish magazine called Fantastyka—the first magazine to strictly popularise fantasy and sci-fi in communist Poland. I am the happy owner of almost all of them. First issue coming out in 1982
    and still coming out until this day it gives me a specific, research timeframe — the post-war communist Poland facing political changes in the XX century. Fantastyka was being created by a large community of young people. I am researching how they
    were escaping to the fantasy world to cope with traumatic experiences from the past. Also trying to understand motifs of fiction in the context of their future, including a possible nuclear annihilation during collapsing Soviet Union.

         <p>
          Poland after the end of World War II in 1945 was practically under the communist regime. ‘The New Government’ totally ignored the real Polish exile-government that was based in London from 1940, The Iron Curtain was efficiently blocking
          anything that could be seen as a threat to the Eastern Bloc, which resulted in limitations towards freedom. The system lasted for 44 years. On 4th June 1989 the Solidarity Union won through the election voting, it finally led to the
          freedom and self-empowerment of the country. Despite all of the hardship, Poland was slowly rebuilding itself from the tragic past. Communist regime of state working policy, nationalisation of industry and integration of private lands,
          indeed helped to rebuild the country and fight with poverty. Nevertheless the society was still restrained. Yet from time to time the Iron Curtain sometimes opened.
          </p>

          <p>
          Back then in the PRL (Polish People’s Republic) press was censored and it was being used by the ruling party propaganda to control society. Every piece of information needed to be approved by ‘The Main Office for the Control of Press,
          Publications and Performances’, which was established immediately after the war. However the literature was still active and fruitful. Rise and development of science fiction novels were significant during that period of time.
          </p>

          <p>
          Most of the Eastern European countries from that time got its own technical magazine equivalent. They were aimed to catch the attention of young adults and strictly encourage interest in science and science fiction. One of the first one
          that appear in Poland was ‘Młody Technik’ (Young Engineer) that originally started in 1932, it was reactivated in September 1950 under the guidance of Zbigniew Przyrowski, that pushed the science fiction in its pages and later on was the
          one to initiate the science fiction story contest in 1962. Many new writers emerged with the help of the monthly printed journal.

          <p>
          The first group that was in the team of Fantastyka came from the National Club of Fantasy and Science Fiction based in Warsaw from 1976, created as a result of the merger of smaller groups of sci-fi enthusiasts. There were few attempts to
          start the magazine earlier, the birth of the magazine took almost 10 years in total. It wasn’t so easy back then in the Polish People’s Republic. Firstly there was still a shortage of paper and spending it on such whims as a science fiction
          magazine was out of the question. Secondly to put it out to the public it was necessary to submit an application to the National Publishing Agency or the Youth Publishing Agency and then the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers'
          Party.
          </p>
          <p>
          The founders were, among others, Andrzej Wójcik, Jacek Rodek, Tadeusz Markowski and Maciej Makowski. Tadeusz Markowski was selected as deputy editor. Another person brought on board in coordinating news and information was Andrzej
          Krzepowski,
          who had been involved before in magazine ‘Alfa’ for selecting text and adaptations. In 1981, year before the first issue during the founding meetings science fiction writers were involved and most important Adam Hollanek, then editor of the
          "Trybuna Ludu" (Tribune of the People). Hollanek, was very much respected writer and journalist. He was the one to became the first chief editor of FANTASTYKA at the age of 60. Rafał Ziemkiewicz recalls this choice as follows: “we began to
          appreciate it as we matured. In my case, it was connected with working in "Fantastyka" - then I saw how difficult he took on a role as a buffer between rebellious literature and party overseers. He did it brilliantly, providing the editors
          and authors with maximum freedom at that time “
